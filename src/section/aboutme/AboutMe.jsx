            Hey there! I'm Saw Nay Thar Poe, originally from Myanmar, While my
            academic journey started with geography, the captivating world of
            web technology grabbed my attention. Now, I'm diving headfirst into
            this dynamic field, fueled by a passion for crafting user-friendly
            web applications.

            I started playing around with a task management system and
            restaurant ordering system. Seeing how technology can make things
            easier for people really interested me. Now, my goal is to simplify
            people's daily lives with user-friendly web apps crafted
            with my passion and expertise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Away from the keyboard, you'll find me enjoying historical dramas,
            tasty snacks, and a good game.
